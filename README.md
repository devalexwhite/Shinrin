# Shinrin

Shinrin is a "walking simulator" style game based in the forests of Japan. Follow the paths to explore deeper into the forest. Discover fellow hikers, new creatures, shrines and beautiful scenery. Setup a basecamp and decorate with your discoveries.

## Development

Shinrin is in very, very, very early development. The game is being created using Monogame (XNA) and will be available on Mac and Windows.
